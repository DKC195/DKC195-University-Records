## Understanding the Concept of Friend Function/Class and Operator Overloading
[Exercise Location](https://www.dsbaral.com.np/subject/cpp/lab_sheet_5)

1. Write a class for instantiating the objects that represent the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.
> A. Make a particular member function of one class as a friend function of another class for addition.
> B. Make the other three functions to work as a bridge between the classes for multiplication, division, and subtraction.
> C. Also write a small program to demonstrate that all the member functions of one class are the friend functions of another class if the former class is made friend to the latter.
> Make least possible classes to demonstrate all the above in a single program without conflict.
2. Write a class to store x, y, and z coordinates of a point in three-dimensional space. Overload addition and subtraction operators for addition and subtraction of two coordinate objects. Implement the operator functions as non-member functions (friend operator functions).
3. Write a program to compare two objects of a class that contains an integer value as its data member. Make overloading functions to overload equality(==), less than(<), greater than(>), not equal (!=), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to(<=) operators using member operator functions.
4. Write a class Date that overloads prefix and postfix operators to increase the Date object by one day, while causing appropriate increments to the month and year (use the appropriate condition for leap year). The prefix and postfix operators in the Date class should behave exactly like the built-in increment operators.
