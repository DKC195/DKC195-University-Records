# Lab Sheet 9
## Understanding the Concept of Templates and Exception
[Exercise Location](https://www.dsbaral.com.np/subject/cpp/lab_sheet_9)

1. Create a function called sum() that returns the sum of the elements of an array. Make this function into a template so it will work with any numerical type. Write a program that applies this function to data of various types.
2. Write a class template for queue class. Assume the programmer using the queue won't make mistakes, like exceeding the capacity of the queue or trying to remove an item when the queue is empty. Define several queues of different data types and insert and remove data from them.
3. Modify the stack class given in the previous lab to add the exception when a user tries to add an item while the stack is full and when the user tries to add the item while the stack is empty. Throw exceptions in both of the cases and handle these exceptions.
4. Write any program that demonstrates the use of multiple catch handling, re-throwing an exception, and catching all exceptions.
